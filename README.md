# Don't Dimmadeck ðŸŽ©

> [!CAUTION]
> This project is in very early development and does not yet do anything that it is intended to do.

A [Decky](https://github.com/SteamDeckHomebrew/decky-loader) Plugin for Steam Deck to disable sceeen dimming and timeout on a per-app basis.

This is useful for games such as the Jackbox Party Packs where players interact using their phones instead of the Deck directly.

Another example would be using YouTube, Netflix, Plex, or any other video streaming service where you do not want the system to go to sleep.

## Installation

This plugin is not yet functional nor in the Decky store. Instructions will be here when it is.
